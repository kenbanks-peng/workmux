description: Remove worktrees, tmux windows, and branches without merging
---

Removes worktrees, tmux windows, and branches without merging (unless you keep the branches). Useful for abandoning work or cleaning up experimental branches. Supports removing multiple worktrees in a single command. Alias: `rm`

```bash
workmux remove [name]... [flags]
```

## Arguments

- `[name]...`: One or more worktree names (the directory names). Defaults to current directory name if omitted.

## Options

| Flag                | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--all`             | Remove all worktrees at once (except the main worktree). Prompts for confirmation unless `--force` is used. Safely skips worktrees with uncommitted changes or unmerged commits. |
| `--gone`            | Remove worktrees whose upstream remote branch has been deleted (e.g., after a PR is merged on GitHub). Automatically runs `git fetch --prune` first.                             |
| `--force, -f`       | Skip confirmation prompt and ignore uncommitted changes.                                                                                                                         |
| `--keep-branch, -k` | Remove only the worktree and tmux window while keeping the local branch.                                                                                                         |

## Examples

```bash
# Remove the current worktree (run from within the worktree)
workmux remove

# Remove a specific worktree with confirmation if unmerged
workmux remove experiment

# Remove multiple worktrees at once
workmux rm feature-a feature-b feature-c

# Remove multiple worktrees with force (no confirmation)
workmux rm -f old-work stale-branch

# Use the alias
workmux rm old-work

# Remove worktree/window but keep the branch
workmux remove --keep-branch experiment

# Force remove without prompts
workmux rm -f experiment

# Remove worktrees whose remote branches were deleted (e.g., after PR merge)
workmux rm --gone

# Force remove all gone worktrees (no confirmation)
workmux rm --gone -f

# Remove all worktrees at once
workmux rm --all
```

## Deferred filesystem cleanup

When removing a worktree from its own terminal target, filesystem cleanup runs
in a detached worker after that target closes. Surviving background processes
can still write into the renamed `.workmux_trash_*` directory. Rust cleanup
continues deleting unrelated files and directories after an individual failure,
using descriptor-relative operations without following symlink targets. Workmux retries
`DirectoryNotEmpty` errors with backoff for a five-second retry window; an
individual recursive deletion can take longer. It does not kill those processes.

Before renaming the worktree, Workmux saves a pending filesystem-cleanup record
under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/workmux/pending-cleanup/` (by default,
`~/.local/state/workmux/pending-cleanup/`). The record includes the original and
quarantine paths and the captured directory's device and inode. It is cleared
only after filesystem deletion succeeds.

If deletion fails, the record remains and the worker writes the error and a
bounded snapshot of remaining entries, along with the paths and errors from
failed deletion operations, to `workmux.log` in the same state directory.
Records also survive failures in intervening Git operations. They are diagnostic
recovery records, not an automatic cleanup queue: inspect them and stop any
remaining writers before manually recovering the exact quarantined directory.
Do not replay branch deletion from a record, since Git cleanup may already have
completed and the original branch or worktree path may have been reused.
